Each physical, non-physical attribute has a value for the animals and
clients indicate a preference.

Assign a score to each attribute such that, for example:

Animal with short fur gets score of 1, long fur gets score of 2
Client preference for short fur gets score of 1, long gets score of 2

Find the difference between each client's score and each animal's score for
every attribute. Add up all of these differences for each match. If the
differences are low then it is a good match for that client.

Loop through all the combinations of clients with animals, matching the clients
with the animals based on these numbers.

If a client indicates that an attribute is "absolutely does not want", assign a
large score so the difference value is very big.
