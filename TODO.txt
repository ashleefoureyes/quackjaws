DETAILED OVERVIEW:
==================

* Write introduction document which pulls from the project description to
  explain what the goals of the project are. Also provide an overview of the
  entire Deliverable #1 document.

* Create a requirements document in a spreadsheet which details the requirements
  of the project. The spreadsheet will have two categories: functional and
  non-functional requirements. In each category, the columns will be:
  Requirement Number, Requirement Name, Requirement Description, Completion
  Status (as a % or as "Complete", "In Progress", etc), Person Assigned.

    * There must be at least three different non-functional requirements for
      each of the 9 functional requirement categories (see S2.2 Slide 41).

* Take the basic numbering, names, and descriptions from the internal
  requirements document and add it to the final deliverable documentation.
