PRODUCTION README

TODO:
- Ensure any input cannot contain ')' or '('. This will mess up parsing of saved data
- Allow for input strings to contain spaces for breeds like: "Egyptian Mau"
- Create Dog and Cat classes that inherit from the Animal class
- Create a .txt file if one doesn't currently exist in the directory. Currently program locks up if .txt file isn't present
- Fix "clock skew detected" error from makefile. Doesn't seem to actually affect program however


Notes:
-Currently input is not checked. Ideally constraints on non-string input will be handle by GUI
- A text file named 139cats.txt is included in the directory. This can be used to pipeline a lot of
  animals into the animal storage for testing purposes
